# FoodFinder

FoodFinder is a web application that allows users to search for food recipes based on ingredients. It utilizes React for the frontend, an Express server for the backend, and the Edamam API to fetch food recipes.

## Features

- Search for food recipes based on ingredients.
- View detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients and preparation steps.
- Save favorite recipes for future reference.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React
  - React Router (for routing)
  - Axios (for making HTTP requests)

- **Backend:**
  - Express
  - Axios (for making HTTP requests to external API)

- **API:**
  - Edamam API (https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api)

## Getting Started

To run FoodFinder locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/foodfinder.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd foodfinder
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following:

   ```
   APP_ID=YOUR_EDAMAM_APP_ID
   API_KEY=YOUR_EDAMAM_APP_KEY
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_EDAMAM_APP_ID` and `YOUR_EDAMAM_APP_KEY` with your actual Edamam API credentials.
   
6. Configure server path on client side:
   ```
   cd frontend/src
   ```
   Replace the SERVER_URL value inside config.js by your server address
   
8. Start the server and frontend separately:

   ```bash
   # Start the server (from the server directory)
   cd backend
   npm start

   # Start the frontend (from the client directory)
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

9. Access the application in your web browser:

   Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to view FoodFinder.
